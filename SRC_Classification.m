% A denotes the dictionary the size of which is n by m, where n and m are the dimension and number of atoms, respectively.
% dict_labels corresponds to the categories labels of the atoms.
% test_sparse_codes denotes the sparse codes of the test samples, and its size is m by k, where k is the number of test samples.
% test_samples denotes the test samples, and its size is n by k.
