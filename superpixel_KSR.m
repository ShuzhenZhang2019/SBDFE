% SPD_SRC_Classification(TrainSet,TestSet,Lparam)  perform kernel based classification 
% given TrainSet and TestSet together with Lparam.
% The size of TrainSet is d by d by n1, where n1 denotes the 
% number of random vector and d is their dimension, the size of TestSet is d
% by d by n2, and TestSet contains the parameters used for computing the
% kernel matrix (c.f. SetParams.m).
